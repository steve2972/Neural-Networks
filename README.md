# Neural Networks in Tensorflow

This is a list of lightweight neural networks designed to be power-efficient and computationally less intensive. A list of the networks provided includes

- MobileNetV2
- ReXNet


This is an open repository and I will add more networks including, but no limited to:

- ResNet
- EfficientNet
- MobileNetV1
- MobileNetV3
- etc...
